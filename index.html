     <p>Iâ€™m Derek Lai from Hong Kong, a passionate designer currently studies at Algonquin College in Ottawa,Canada. With a background in  visual and Communication Design from Shu-Te University in Taiwan, Over the last few years, I learn the foundations of visual design, theory ,print and digital design skills. In order to become a professional designer, I want to continue to study, to have more experience and knowledge in this field.
     Therefore, I have chosen to take the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College in Canada. I think this program can let me be creative and able to execute my ideas through different medium and method, gave me the opportunity to conceptualize and develop design solutions using principles of design, to create visual communications that meet the needs of the project.
